this sound track was beautiful it paints the senery in your mind so well i would recomend it even to people who hate vid game music i have played the game chrono cross but out of all of the games i have ever played it has the best music it backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras it would impress anyone who cares to listen  great cd my

play this no matter black white young old male female everybody says one thing who was that singing ', ' the best soundtrack ever to anything im reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best game soundtrack and i figured that id write a review to disagree a bit this in my opinino is yasunori mitsudas ultimate masterpiece the music is timeless and im been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fadethe price tag on this is pretty staggering i must say but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money this is the only one that i feel would be worth every penny  one of the best game music soundtracks for a game i didnt really play despite the fact that i have only played a small portion of the game the music i heard plus the connection to chrono trigger which was great as well led me to purchase the soundtrack and it remains one of my favorite albums there is an incredible mix of fun epic and emotional songs those sad and beautiful tracks i especially like as theres not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks i must admit that one of the songs lifea distant promise has brought tears to my eyes on many occasionsmy one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs which i find distracting but even if those werent included i would still consider the collection worth it ', ' amazing this soundtrack is my favorite music of all time hands down the intense sadness of prisoners of fate which means all the more if youve played the game and the hope in a distant promise and girl who stole the star have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years the higher energy tracks like chrono cross times scar time of the dreamwatch and chronomantique indefinably remeniscent of chrono trigger are all absolutely superb as wellthis soundtrack is amazing music probably the best of this composers work i havent heard the xenogears soundtrack so i cant say for sure and even if youve never played the game it would be worth twice the price to buy iti wish i could give it stars  batteries died within a year i bought this charger in jul and it worked ok for a while the design is nice and convenient however after about a year the batteries would not hold a charge might as well just get alkaline disposables or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power ', ' excellent soundtrack i truly like this soundtrack and i enjoy video game music i have played this game and most of the music on

suitable for many people looking for a versatile productcons no universal remote ', ' an absolute masterpiece i am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once and heard at least a few of the tracks here and whether you were aware of it or not mitsudas music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole gamecomposed of cds and quite a few songs i havent an exact count all of which are heartrendering and impressively remarkable this soundtrack is one i assure you you will not forget it has everything for every listener from fastpaced and energetic dancing the tokage or termina home to slower and more haunting dragon god to purely beautifully composed times scar to even some fantastic vocals radical dreamersthis is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there and surely mitsudas best ever  dvd player crapped out after one year i also began having the incorrect disc problems that ive read about on here the vcr

didnt feel like the two main characters were in love in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroines point of view and i was getting sick of her whining and her point of view unlike the dark series you really didnt feel any passion the book is better suited for the mysterygothic genre and not romanceeven the mystery was not that good its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages throughout the entire book youre kept in suspense of who was the bad guy if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of

herself as she seems to be always one against the world marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic in this book kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings it appears that a recently executed murderer who kay herself has seen on her autopsy table is still around committing crimes a number of murders occur where the executed murderers fingerprints are turning up kay marino and benton try to track a killer but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political

bought was defective the dvd didnt work at all i purchased it from electronics express and when i contacted them they were wonderful they gave me an rma number right away fedex picked it up the next

running i can barely hear it i solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the tv to the input on the rv stereo speaker system its very lightweight and easy to move around and store a bonus for the rv the remote isnt great but it works just fine and the videoaudio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the dvd player all in all its a great deal for the price  great

pregnancy just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies i dont like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like i have back boobs the shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesnt feel smooth all over squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better

wore for about hours and then the nd time i wore it had it on for about the same period of time i took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom

main character hester prynne is forced to wear a scarlet letter a for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from europethe book really recaptures what puritanism was like its interesting to think about what america would be like if we were still puritan a theme of the book is concealed guilt the minister arthur dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain the message of the book is that you shouldnt let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your lifethe book denounces the religious atmosphere of the puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of old england you get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of chaucer was lost in america due to the influence of the puritans ', ' omg soulwax owns wow this is like the most amazing album ever every track so rocksspecially etalking nylipps i love techogreat job guysmusicchoice played their whole album this

been placed on banned lists in several states its an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt although the story does allude frequently to adultery there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear ', ' very not worth your time the book was wriiten very horribly i would never in my life recommend such a book the stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was the only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages  the scarlet letter a must read for any american the best book that i have ever been assigned to read for school by far the way in which hawthorne captures the shame that hetser the wearer of the scarlet letter feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with hester and the revenge ridden character of chillingworth is spectactularthe way in which hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader since hester the main character concieved her daughter pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet a on her chest for the rest of her life the story starts on the day hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of boston starts from there a must read for any american ', ' very fun and

is a soap opera and a bad one at that not only is it boring no true action occurs in this book nothing truly interesting happens in this book this boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison dooralthough the author did a creative job of conveying his point this is still the worst book i have ever read i would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first pages this is a good book to study however it is not a good book to read for pleasure under any circumstance ', ' ludicrous and silly i remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it basically while i will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories this book was basically silly  this book is great one might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors although i respect those who disliked the scarlet letter i

expecting much but man was i wrong i loved this book now i may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt but the authors really made colin into this enchanting highlander

be the print quality is so bad that i cannot read it zero stars would have been more appropriate ', ' not the best in the series tess lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when colin macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with colin soon tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new lifethe beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem the plot loses much of its believability mostly due to the poor characterization all of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason even tess and colins development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced the writing does improve towards the end but its not enough to save the book unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series skip this one  used for circuits project i used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance however

disappointed in its performance i am disappointed in its performance it seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read cds half the time unsuccessfully i am going to try to return it to amazon  two tedious hours the early success of adam sandlers films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer this film proves he is neither and a grating voiceover guy to boot i enjoyed happy gilmore and to a much lesser degree little nicky and big daddy but sandler is a onetrick pony weve all seen the trick so its just not interesting anymore i thought this might be the one hanukah film in a world of xmas fare it has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids ', ' too uncomfortable and too big these pants were way too big looked about sizes larger and they were incredibly stiff they would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day  one of the worst movies of god what a dumb movie the fact that adam sandler can do this is just wrongnever lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheesesick and demented jokes dont help its premisethough whitey gets a few lifesnicely animated but a poor outcome think of this as a guide beofer watching itjon lovitz rob schneider and others contribute voices ', ' very authentic this is my first encounter with yoruba and i have to say that cds are really helping however the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances for someone who never spoke yoruba and doesnt have anybody to ask for a clue it leaves a lot of questions unanswered for this however there are hopefully other yoruba textbookson the brighter note i would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on yoruba people and yoruba culture in general i would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn yoruba you cant go wrong with it  fantastic a movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays although not a childish movie eight crazy nights is a fantastic sandler movie ', ' not the best i agree the cds are a much needed help since it would be impossible to pronnounce the yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker however the design of the book is really poor and confusing i have found several spealling mistakes in english and yoruba and the grammar explanations are very hard to understandunfortunately there are not many teach yourself yoruba books that are worth it this one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills  very disappointing the movie is vulgar and not meant for children it is a typical adam sandler movie with foul language and raunchy humor not enjoyable at all ', ' doesnt fit i ordered this dashmat for a specific vehicle it was not the correct mat i returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat i cant seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box  sandler strikes out crazy nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids but the scatological humor offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my year old the plot on the other hand while fine for year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience as a result while its probably not the worst film of the year it is certainly in the running ', ' you need a good memory i play this with my grandchildren it teaches us both the value of a good memory and is challenging for all you sometimes miss the most obvious lots of funtic tac toe with a twist  not the worst but far from good this film has the dubious honor to be included in the book the worst films of all time it is definently not one of those but one can hardly call it a proper film either it is rather a loose framework in which new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner a greatgreatgrandfather of music videos and better than some of those ', ' kelly club pet

everything she has accomplished along the way and then well watch her special parade a wonderfully cute game that i highly recommendshe can mostly do the entire game on her own i have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game the only one she has a tough time with is the polar bear catching fish game its tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish it would be much easier using a regular mouse  been waiting for a foreign lauguage aol cd i have too but this isnt it the translation is very choppy the singers are medicore at best and the orchestrations are too overwhelming love changes everything is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to itoddly the best song is the french chanson denfancei was very surprised as the japanese usually put out extramely good cast cds their cats and phantom and the tokoyo evita are all great but unless you are a total alw or aol fanatic save your money ', ' loads of fun my year old and year old both really enjoy this game has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade you get to design a float and it just endless fun graphics and animation are very colorful and cute its a winner  it rises above the fluff books the first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read the print was readable and the illustrations were helpful i did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said but mostly it was very specific and practical the chapters most helpful were on emotional states and music its hard to find a book on this subject thats across the board dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brainrelated research issue from nutrition to memory as a scientist who also works with high school students i found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful if not enthusiastic its a tough subject to translate but i did get more than i thought i would out of the book mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material the books far from perfect but its the best ive seen so far on this topic ', ' easy and fun for yr olds fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing ive reinstalled it and done everything i know to do to correct the issue its a shame my yr old really likes it  itten the elements of

mikes album since he thinks he can do better seriously i think some people dont understand that things sound the way they were meant to sound if they sound poppy they made it that way why the hell should they stick to the norm they want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds greati cant write a good enough review for this album all their albums actually as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting it bugs me when a group doesnt evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were all the time so i was glad to see them progress and growtheres too much to say to describe this album but frankly i dont think i could write a good enough review to do it justice so ill just give it my stars ', '

review of the book not of the work of edgar allan poe as a poe fan i purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading poe on my kindle however the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it while there is a table of contents the individual works are not list there rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know or guess to which group the work you may be looking for belongs alas there is also no index this is an electronic book i should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular

learning etc a lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids which really doesnt apply in small towns like we live in some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods a lot of real life examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approachprobably the most novel idea that came across was that its better

owning a home is more expensive than not owning this is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home he argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage but the details he left out just to make his useless point is the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month whereas the person who doesnt own a home has to pay may be k per year for rent that wipes out the savings that the author is claiming not only that that money is down the drain since it goes to the

heard the other volumes in the series and so i cannot compare them with each other my only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent some are more

and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one this vacuum is very powerful however the handle hose is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use by

reading  typical thomas video all about james the biggest problem with this dvd is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on jamess brake line the episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the dvd it would have taken like more minutes to have the videos play

the box said it includes a bonus wooden train my box actually had a take along bertie in it my son didnt have a bertie so i was eager to get it but i didnt realize it was a metal take along kind not a

going on that you become addicted to him i started reading these books years ago but they went out of print i would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how i can get them i would recommend these books to anyone of any age i mean im now and i still love them  inexpensive but poor quality the set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oillike substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous also the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened or dulled however you look at it i have difficulties cutting through even thin soft silicone sheets sharpening them with a rotary tool helps but i feel i shouldnt have to do that with a brand new product which i am sure is actually repackaged i cant imagine using them for metal let alone most

sounds so complete in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes even in places you wouldnt expect it like orchestral workouts river of orchids and green manis

maincharacter vampires are all male and the witches female  a worthy addition to ww ii eastern front histories ive read a tremendous amount on the subject of ww ii history so very rarely do i read a book with anything new to tell me this book is in that class and wellwritten too the two points i found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of hitlers campaign in russia and the first extensive history ive read about the airlift effort to save paulus th army trapped at stalingrad he offers original research into the question of just who promised hitler that the luftwaffe

pencil and if you use gel pens the ink bleeds through to the other side the squares to color in are too large making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out also the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle instead of left and top making it more difficult for a righthanded person to see while solvingsave your money and buy the games magazine publication

conclusions from the facts rather than spoonfeeding us his unsubstantiated opinion but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy very readable manner the only explanation i could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under reviewbravo professor hofstader i regret that you did not live to

you face two deciphering the nealry pages of rediculously long sentences and staying awake i even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time because the energy you must invest to

year and i wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently this book doesnt promise eternal life or give any religious message in several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life my girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime which i found slightly surprising ', ' nifty it is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way works well too  effective book for discussing physical death with a child as a public school librarian i would say that lifetimes is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child or children in dealing with the subject of death however as a person of faith i would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after deaththe text states nothing that is alive goes on living for ever this statement either reflects the authors intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death or it could be interpreted as their belief statement this is why id suggest that lifetimes be read by or shared with a caring adult who would be able to answer a childs questions based on a familys belief system ', ' grandson enjoyed maybe times fine boys and the toys or trains i forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again

stories after watching them on pbs with my daughter next time i will try to find those stories on video they actually last about minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people i dont know

just soso this is a dvd with footage of a come out and meet thomas day mixed in between the episodes sort fo a promotional piece to be honest still decent enough to rent the dvd extras are limited and

which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child also i for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me this production has the feel of an old vhs video copied to dvd without much added to it i wouldnt throw it out but i wouldnt buy it either  this book is messed up in this book not only is there no real love scenes but to top it off the girls cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate granted angel is dead but hes still related to her and definately should not be trying to catch his own cousin ewww to top off the wrongness that is this book there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff also this is a coming of age story about how being popluar isnt the most important i love every other night world book but this is retarded ', ' more than thomas not geared toward children as much i bought this thinking it would be packed with thomas stories turns out there are only ten which is a typical thomas dvd however between each story it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about thomas as i parent im not interested in this and i know that my year old would rather watch thomas than a bunch of strangers any day plus the singalong section has one song one we have other thomas videos that has at least and they arent special dvds just normal thomas collections i wouldnt recommend this to anyone if you are looking for solely thomas stories and can find other collections  impressive one of the few cds of asatru music that i actually enjoy i could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore but overall i find the music both pleasant and inspiringthis cd draws upon scandinavian folk music for inspiration for

philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions read this book and be prepared to question your own thoughts perceptions might change after an afternoon with this book ', ' poor dvd has too many interviews with people at the live thomas day in penn my kids were annoyed and hated this dvd  not what id hoped for i had expected or at least hoped for a more or less straightforward account of the mothman phenomenon of some years ago instead this meandering book comprises hick ufo sightings that are only infrequently connected with mothman and keels trustmei knowwhatimtalkingabout theories and explanations i was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men in black behaving badly with little to recommend it and aside from providing

a coherent story it starts strong just enough to draw you in then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole were led to believe that mr keel is a sensiable unbiased investigator when really hes a parinoid delusional whack im only and i dont buy a word of it see the movie instead ', ' feels like a commercial all the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains

point to all of it or if at least such entries are entertaining this books are albeit only in the beginning after a while youll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if thats just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing stylethis book wasnt worth the timeor the title theres hardly anything about the mothman in it ', ' makes you not want to sleep at night this is about a kid who when asleep unleashes something horrific part two of the night warriors it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to

handling and there are deals out there from major store chains i was really disappointed in this product and the seller go to walmart and get their khakis they are very inexpensive and wear like iron  repetitive and monotone i really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art instead i found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever she repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book she reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that i stopped caring about her situation her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they dont really lead to anything of interest later on her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves the title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother aside from her death during childbirth i am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly ', ' fantastic book this book is a modern retelling of sleeping beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time it is best suited for a mature inquisitive child war is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children  worst book ive ever read

quality this was the first book i attempted to read by the author since i couldnt waste my time trying to finish it i am pretty sure i wont be reading any other books by jamaica kincade ', ' disturbing although the images are very well rendered they arefrightening i am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children this book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of wwii in berlin the most horrifying image is that of major kreigs big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy this book is not appropriate for younger readers i can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher  frankenstein continued when i first heard about this book i wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation fortunately a continuationi had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock i bought it i read it in days reading each night after work i can say it was a good read steady flowing action no real dull moments no unnecessary story lines etc i was not disappointed at alli gave it only stars much for the same reason others have the ending was rushed and abrupt but never fear there is to be more books before the real ending so we all have something to look forward tothis is only the second koontz book i have read so i was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing more die hard koontz fans may be able to tell the differenceso overall a good smooth never dull read highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist ', ' a taste of italy longing for vicarious travel

tomasso in fact it was nice to see how cappella put his spin on the cyrano story the descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere though at times were a trifle overdone pun intended the only thing that kept me from giving this a was the authors descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic too male perhaps like reading

metaphor for love and lovemaking but seems a more than adequate substitute people have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizingi can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot openly cribbed from cyrano de bergerac the most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters

a chance but now im permanently going to start ignoring every cd with a cash money record label on it theyre cash money millionaires and why because they fill a cd with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats theyre millionaires because they repeat the words huh what and yeah for every or minute song they make theyre millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next big thing make them millionaires bottom line hotboys are garbage and so is every other artist signed onto the cash money label i will never consider this good music and i hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what socalled hiphop music is coming tothen i only hope its worth your money cause i aint gonna spend a penny on it  forsyte saga a well awarded but oft forgotten classic ill make this short and to the point im quite the avid reader but usually i dont enjoy books of this nature opting for fantasy and scifi escapism instead this story is just beautifully told though the subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner i was hooked immediately i honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book and i urge you to give it a shot i know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more adventure action type books but there is no lack of excitement here ', ' this album is garbagestraight bfi material cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this gamethe beats where alright but the rappers a terriblenone of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beatstry again cmrmaybe next time  the book is great but the edition is an embarrasment for oxford university press there are quite a few annoying typos i can see how the new forsyte by the name scames or the unlisted french word ficbe came about as a result of faulty character recognition but how soames born in got to be thirtyeight in in is beyond me dont they have proofreaders anymoreby all means read the bookyou may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from itbut not in this edition ', ' i feel ya ghenryaolthis cd rocks no limit cant i feel ya ghenryaolcomthis cd rocks no limit cant touch cash money records i dont know why that new tru cd sold one million in

favorite song is help by bg i love this cd  expensive experiment that didnt work i was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use well this is pretty convenient just swipe but it did nothing for me i wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts however my skin remained the same and while it doesnt really have a scent there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because i have quite a sensitive nose i switched to using them on my back and got the same result which was nothing so it was an expensive experiment that didnt work it may work for someone else but it did nothing for me most disappointing i have since switched to the salicylic gel peel which hurts a whole lot more but gets the job done ', ' save your i

when watching them the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous to see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired though i started martial arts at years old and became a head instructor at i have more skills that i need to perfect i just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised ', ' please dont buy this cd i was truly disappointed in this album the beats are all overused and unoriginal the only thing that makes this album is young turk he has the hottest rap out of all the hot boys if you havent heard his freestyle you dont know whats up turk is off da chains i cant wait for his solo album to drop yall need to recognize quit hatin turk  small type my review centers on only one thing the type size this edition is disappointingly and in my humble opinion unnecessarily small increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and at most increase the book length by about a hundred pages since it is currently at almost pages i feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another pages with no problemwhat makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldnt require a magnifying glass if it was just a little largeri really dont believe our lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read his word nor do i think he wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the his purpose ', ' worst music everbut i love it i dont know if you can actually call this music it is truly terrible however i love listening to it for some strange music i am not normally a fan of rap music but i laugh out loud every time i hear some of these songs these cash money guys should be comedians except for

is nothing compared to juveniles degreez if you dont have degreez go buy that one instead of this  can i shoot myself now a few years back i was forced to read tess for my english class nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book only a few of us could ever even finish the cliff notes for it our professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into ittess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women yes even at that time this book is overrated and should not be called a classic if you really want to read good literature read

which seems out of place ', ' super hot lil wayne and turk set the whole cd off the untamed killer seem to know how to flow his beats are for real and i cant wait for lil wayne to come out with his solo cd  cruel and depressing story hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society they are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending he had created a virtuous women in the
