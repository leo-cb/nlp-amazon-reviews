nice product at the price range in big billion days many people are saying battery backup is not good but nothing to expect from small battery go for androids those who are giving negative reviews about battery
except battery backup ever thing is fine
battery backup is not good except all are good
bought it because i wanted a small phone with all features after five months of usage i find this phone to be a power packed super horse very fast processing no lags whatsoever decent battery backup with a total screen time of about hrs a day with bluetooth wifi dual sim and location always on the battery lasts a full day easily fits into the hand upper bezel could have been shorter to make it more smaller best option for people like me who dont like big screen phones
if you are looking for st iphone ios exp then this is best phone at this price but if you are heavy user then battery backup might be an issue
mobile is absolutely nice but battery backup is not good
well i am quite happy using it the issue is just related to battery backup but i guess its with every iphone and i got it at a very cheap price so all and all its a good deal
performance wise best product screen could have little broad please go and check nearest store for screen size as it may appear very small to some people who are used to big screen phone camera is very good battery backup is also goodit last a day for normal use overall compact product with very good specifications fits in your pocket well unlike big heavy screen phones highly recommended
very very nice product but weak about battery backup
overall good but battery backup is bad
very poor battery backup
perfect buy camera quality better than iphone x and lower than iphone battery backup terrible performance excellentbest phone you can get in this price
iphone se battery backup very poor mah battery not a generation phone
all the best but battery backup is weak every thing you manage therefore battery backup is one day
i replaced my iphone with this one for better battery backup because that was now years old but this phone is showing the same backup issue the second thing is its wifi reception seems to have issue at few point at my home where all other devices works my phone shows lte rather the wifi i have reset the network setting but still facing same issuerest everything is good sound photo quality all good
too good performancebattery backup is not good charge twice a dayif you are using inch display phone earlier it will be difficult to adjust with this mini screen suggest go with bigger display
battery backup is very poor
i am reviewing it after using months it has lot of features good camera performance but battery backup is low battery health drain to in simple usage
people talk about its battery backup man im in love with this handset so clean so smooth smoother than xr if youve used both youll understand camera better than xr battery of xr is better but still ill vote for se because of a bionic chip touch haptics and many more reasons its a beast in this segment still i want you all to feel this beast in your hand sexy as it looks just a perfect masterpiece
powerful iphone but the size is too small at least the apple could have opted for full display feature specially in this price range it doesnt seem suitable for gamingwatching movies or series etc battery backup is average but a chip makes it a powerful iphone performance wise
